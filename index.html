          <p>University application is an important process for every students who want to get admitted. Universities require a lot of information in applications such as personal information of applicants, academic performance, wokring experience and etc. Each university places different emphasis on each factor. Some universities consider the academic performance as the most important quality and some universities focus on comprehensive skills. In the current time, university application especialy for graduate school becomes more and more competitive which makes finding out qualified applicants difficult. Thus, understanding what factors the university cares about become very important for determning appropriate applicants. <strong>The goal of our project is to analyze factors that may influence admission decisions using summer admission data of a univeristy.</strong> We think our analysis can help  the university in two aspects. First, the admission offfice can understand if there is any bias in admission process. Second, the university can understand what quality they are looking for.</p>

          <p>The original data is synthesized, so it doesn't represent any real situations. In our analysis, we assume the data is collected from the admission office. It contains 88 admission results and applicants' information in 8 features, including</p>

            <br>&emsp;<strong>TestScore:</strong> test score on a 1000 scale
            <br>&emsp;<strong>WritingScore:</strong> writing score on a 100 scale
            <br>&emsp;<strong>Gender:</strong> gender of the applicant (0 or 1)
            <br>&emsp;<strong>Volunteer:</strong> measure how many volunteer work the applicant done (0 to 5)

      <h5 class="mb-4" >Decision</h5>
      <p>
        One applicant has decision of "Banna". This is an obvious error values. This applicant has high GPA, test score and writing score, so we guess the applicant is likely to be admiited. Thus, we change the "Banna" to "Admit".

      <p>Some state names are in lower case in the original data. We capitalize the first letter of all states.</p>
      
      <h5 class="mb-4" >GPA</h5>
      <p>The 4.0 GPA scale should have values between 0.0 and 4.0. One applicant has GPA of 6.0 which is outside the normal range. We use the mean of GPA to replace this error value.</p>

      <p>One applicant has 100 years work experience which is obviously impossible. We use the mean of WorkExp to replace this error value.</p>

      <p>
        One applicant has gender of -1 while the gender should only has 0 or 1. We use the mode of Gender to replace this error value.

                <p class="card-text">Extracurricular activities is an important part in university applications. These activities can demonstrate applicants' interest and knowledge beyond the regular coursework. The admission office can understand applicants' personality and comprehensive skills through extracurricular activities. Although almost all universities require such activities, they place different emphasis on activities. In this section, we use volunteer level as an example of extracurricular activities to analyze how it affects admission decisions in the university.</p>

          </section>
        </section>
        
        <p>The visulization shows number of volunteer levels by admission. The number of each volunteer level is similar for admitted applicants. <strong>This means the university attempts to keep volunteer level balanced. We think the university has no preference for a specific volunteer level.</strong> However, this doesn't mean the admission rate is the same for every volunteer level. For example, 50% of applicants with volunteer level 0 are admitted, but only 1/3 of applicants with volunteer level 1 are admitted. This difference is caused by the gap between the number of volunteer level 0 and 1. The volunteer level 0 has 12 applicants and level 1 has 18. To keep volunteer level balanced, the university has to decline more applicants with level 1. The minority level should has higher admission rate than the majority level. However, this conclusion is useless for applicants because they have no information about the volunteer level distribution for all applicants, so they don't know if thy are in the minority level.</p>
