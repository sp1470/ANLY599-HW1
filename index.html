          <h3 class="mb-4" >Introduction</h3>
          <p>University application is an important process for every student who want to get admitted. Universities require a lot of information in applications such as personal information of applicants, academic performance, work experience, etc. Each university places different emphasis on each factor. Some universities consider the academic performance as the most important quality and some universities focus on comprehensive skills. In the current time, competitions between universities become more and more intense which brings a lot of pressure to admission offices. Thus, understanding what factors the university cares about become very important for attracting applicants. <strong>The goal of our project is to analyze factors that may influence admission decisions using summer admission data of a university. We will make strategies to attract more students to apply to the university which increases the number of applications.</strong></p>

      <p>
        One applicant has decision of "Banna". This is an obvious error value. This applicant has high GPA, test score and writing score, so we guess the applicant is likely to be admitted. Thus, we change the "Banna" to "Admit".

        </section>
          <p>The following square area graph shows the proportions of decisions in the data. The admit rate is 35% whereas the decline/waitlist are nearly equal. Therefore, we recommend the university to increase more admit rate by decreasing waitlist percentage. In the following sections, we analyze how different factors influence admission decisions.

              <p class="card-text">Extracurricular activity is an important part in university applications. These activities can demonstrate applicants' interest and knowledge beyond the regular coursework. The admission office can understand applicants' personality and comprehensive skills through extracurricular activities. Although almost all universities require such activities, they place different emphasis on activities. In this section, we use volunteer level as an example of extracurricular activities to analyze how it affects admission decisions in the university.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center; color: black" ><strong>Figure 2. Number of volunteer levels by admission decision</strong></div>
        
        <p>The visualization shows number of volunteer levels by admission. The number of each volunteer level is similar for admitted applicants. <strong>This means the university attempts to keep volunteer level balanced. We think the university has no preference for a specific volunteer level.</strong> However, this doesn't mean the admission rate is the same for every volunteer level. For example, 50% of applicants with volunteer level 0 are admitted, but only 1/3 of applicants with volunteer level 1 are admitted. This difference is caused by the gap between the number of volunteer level 0 and 1. The volunteer level 0 has 12 applicants and level 1 has 18. To keep volunteer level balanced, the university declines more applicants with level 1. The minority level should have higher admission rate than the majority level. However, this conclusion is useless for applicants because they have no information about the volunteer level distribution for all applicants, so they don't know if they are in the minority level.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center; color: black" ><strong>Figure 3. Distribution of GPA and test score by admission</strong></div>
        
        <p>The distribution of GPA by admission displays an obvious pattern that the admitted applicants have higher GPA than waitlisted and declined applicants. The median GPA of the admitted applicants is 3.77 which is higher than 3.5 of the waitlisted and 3.27 of the declined. The minimum GPA of the admitted applicants is 3.5 which means the university doesn't admit students who have GPA lower than 3.5. The distribution of test score also shows that the admitted applicants have higher test scores than other applicants. All applicants who have test score higher than 900 are admitted and most of admitted applicants are above 950. However, there are two admitted applicants who have relatively low test scores. Maybe, their other factors are very good which make up for their low test scores. <strong>Based on these boxplots, we can conclude that the university has strong preference for students having high GPA and test scores.</strong> However, this statement only explains a part of patterns. In the left plot, the distribution of GPA for students who got declined is widespread and thus we can say that GPA is just not enough to gain admission. On the contrary, the distribution of test score is more concentrated that all test scores which are higher than 950 are admitted. Therefore, the test score has more significance compared to GPA.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center; color: black" ><strong>Figure 4. Distribution of writing score by admission</strong></div>
        <p><strong>In the boxplot above, we can visualize that a student who scores higher than 87 has a higher chance of being admitted.</strong> We can also say that a student who scores between 71 and 85 has a high chance of being waitlisted. On the other hand, a student who scores less than 70 is more likely to be rejected. It's worth mentioning that other factors could affect one's admission decision. For example, some students with scores higher than 85% were still waitlisted or rejected. As for outliers, there are a few in the admitted student group, as some students with a writing score of 1 or 11 were still admitted. This is quite abnormal, and I would suggest the university to investigate these outliers.</p>

        <p>
          From the plot above, we can visualize that California has the highest number of student acceptances while Mississippi has the lowest. It is worth mentioning that some states such as New York, Georgia, Vermont, Oregon, etc. only has one student that applied to college therefore some students were either rejected or waitlisted. <strong>Therefore, we cannot make a definitive statement about whether states affect admission rates, because many states have very few applicants.</strong>

        <div style="text-align: center; color: black" ><strong>Figure 6. Student work experience by state and admission decision</strong></div>
        <p>
          This plot shows how an applicant's work experience and state can influence their admission decision. As seen in the plot, some states such as California have more applicants than other states due to the lack of applicants from certain states. By analyzing the admitted students, we can observe that students from California with 2.86 years of work experience were accepted followed up by Florida whose students had 1.6 years of work experience, Colorado students who had 1.46 years of work experience, and finally Utah students with 1.2 years of worth of experience. For waitlisted students, applicants from Florida with 2.52 years of work experience are waitlisted followed up with students from California and Colorado with nearly 1.88 years of work experience and Utah with 1.37 years of experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>To conclude, we can't say that a person with more work experience has a higher chance of getting admitted.</strong> Multiple factors are taken before a student gets admitted. For example, a student from Mississippi who has 6.2 years of work experience was rejected but this could be the applicant not satisfying other criteria such as GPA or test score.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center; color: black" ><strong>Figure 7. GPA vs. work experience</strong></div>
        <p>The trend line shows that there is a slight negative correlation between Work experience and GPA of candidates that got declined. Therefore, the higher the GPA is, the lower is the work experience. To summarize, an applicant who has a higher GPA doesn’t necessarily have a higher chance of acceptance as multiple factors are considered before an applicant is accepted.</p>

        <p>
          From the above plot, we see that for every decision category, the number of males (i.e., considering code 1 as male and other as females) is higher. Therefore, we can conclude that overall, the applicants pool contained a majority of male students. We can also see that gender 1 is 33% more of the gender 0 in decision categories 'ADMIT' and 'DECLINE' which means that<strong> a gender of a person is not necessary influencing in decision.</strong>

          <h3 class="mb-4" >Conclusion</h3>
          <p>From the overall analysis, we can conclude that volunteer levels do not have much significance in application decisions. The spread for GPA for students who got declined is wide however, the test-score spread of students who got accepted is towards the higher end which means test score is given preference above GPA. There is a negative correlation between GPA and Work experience and so it is better to encourage students to gain more work experience along with focusing on maintaining GPA and thus the curriculum should maybe be adjusted. We see that mostly several states had just 1 student applying whereas the majority of students application came from Floride, Colorado and California. It is important to diversify the student body and promote the university by visiting college fairs as well as using social media to advertise. Finally, we see that there is not much difference between the proportions of the students who got declined and the ones who got waitlisted, therefore, the university should consider on accepting more students and reducing their waitlist.</p>
