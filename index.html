        </div>

        <p>Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company under the Pokémon media franchise. With popular anime series, films, and products, Pokémon is considered to be the largest media franchise. Pokémon Go, a spin-off game, has received more than 1 billion mobile game downloads globally. </p>

        <div style="text-align: center; color: black" ><strong>Figure 1. &nbsp Top 20 Pokémon subreddits</strong></div>
        <p>As the world's largest IP, Pokémon also has a large number of fans and players in the United States. On Reddit, everyone enjoys talking about games and animation-related topics. From January 2021 to August 2022, there are 20 subreddits related to Pokémon with at least 18000 submissions. The r/Pokémon subreddit has more than 4 million submissions. As the largest unofficial Pokémon fan community, players' views should be taken into consideration by game production companies and publishing companies. </p>
        <p>Therefore, we decide to analyze user submissions data on Reddit in order to extract any potential commercial intelligence that may be hidden behind users' perspectives. Assist the organization in better comprehending player comments on the game and ensuring that gamers continue to receive an improved gaming experience. In addition, we will try to solve relevant business questions through natural language processing and machine learning models, such as predicting Nintendo's stock through the number of posts on Reddit and classifying submissions to their subreddit based on submission contents. This will help us better understand the relationship between players, games, and social platforms, as well as put forward the direction for the social development of games in the future.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center; color: black" ><strong>Figure 2. &nbsp Number of submissions for Pokémon games</strong></div>
        <p>In this project, we found that Pokémon go, Pokémon TCG, and Pokémon Sword and Shield are the game that has aroused the most discussion. A deeper examination of its logic from a commercial perspective is essential, and there are lessons to be drawn from the unparalleled success. Players expect and love to participate in and discuss the annual birthday events and new version updates. Nintendo's marketing approach is successful. Both the overall user base and user stickiness have increased. The most active author's submissions generally lack commercial value and are unsuitable for businesses to spend additional time and money on.  Most of the content submitted by the most active authors lacks commercial value, and only a few active authors can publish high-quality content for a long time. Enterprises need to cooperate selectively according to their own marketing plans and costs. Everyone on Reddit has a favorable opinion of Pokémon in general, and gamers are eager to share their advice and appreciation on the social platform.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center; color: black" ><strong>Figure 3. &nbsp Number of sentiments in top 5 Pokémon subreddits </strong></div>
        <p>The ratio of positive sentiments for r/Pokémon, r/pokemontrades, and r/PokemonSwordAndShield is over 60%. The three newer games, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (BDSP), Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have also received attention and discussion from players. As the ace Pokémon of the protagonist in the first anime series, Charizard’s cool appearance and strong performance in anime gave people very impressive memory. The popularity of Charizard lasts for decades and in the current day, it's still the most popular Pokémon on social media. The beautiful and well-designed Pokémon will get more love and attention from players, such as the different evolutions of Eevee.</p>

        <br><br><h4 class="mb-4" > Research Directions</h4>
        <h5 class="mb-4">1. What is the most popular subreddit related to Pokémon from January 2021?</h5>
          <p>Business goal: Determine popular subreddits related to Pokémon. Help company to understand what the most popular field about Pokémon is in social media.</p>
          <p>Technical proposal: Choose keywords to filter Pokémon related subreddits. Use regex to filter all subreddits related to Pokémon using keywords on submissions data. Remove subreddits which contain too much useless information. Count number of submissions in each subreddit and rank them in descending order. Present top 20 subreddits with a graph to show subreddits with top popularity. Repeat the same filtering process on comments data. Save both filtered data into parquets and use them for future analysis.</p>
        <h5 class="mb-4">2. What Pokémon events are successful marketing campaigns that can attract discussion and attention from players and interested parties?</h5>
          <p>Business goal: Determine the trend of change in numbers of submissions in top 3 Pokémon subreddits.</p>
          <p>Technical proposal: Select submissions and comments in the top 3 subreddits. Transfer UNIX timestamps to human readable time format specifically yyyy-mm-dd. Conduct counts of number of posts over time in different subreddits for submission data and comment data separately. Aggregate two count results by time to create time series data. Save the created time series data to csv for future time series analysis. Present result with time series graphs.</p>
        <h5 class="mb-4">3. Does the most active author in reddit have commercial value?</h5>
          <p>Business goal: Determine influential users in top 3 popular Pokémon subreddits.</p>

          <p>Technical proposal: At the end of August 2022, there are 905 different Pokémons in Pokémon database. We regard Pokémons at the same evolution chain and different evolutions with the same origin as one Pokémon. Create a list of 15 Pokémon names which are potential candidates of the most popular Pokémon. Create dummy variables for each selected Pokémon using regex. Also, create dummy variables for all categories of Legendary Pokémon. Perform summation over dummy variables and sort result in descending order. Present result in a summary table.</p>

          <p>Business goal: Perform sentiment analysis on Pokémon subreddits posts. Determine the overall attributes in each subreddits.</p>
          <p>Technical proposal: Use NLP to clean submission and comment texts. Split texts into sentences and convert all words into lowercase. Remove html links, punctuations, stop words, and special characters (emoji) from sentences. Use a pretrained sentiment analysis model and build Spark NLP pipeline. Use the pipeline to perform sentiment analysis on submission and comment bodies. Count number of sentiments in subreddits and present the result as a table.</p>
        <h5 class="mb-4">8. The newest Pokémon anime, Pokémon Journeys: The Series, received a lot of bad reviews over the past year. How does people’s attitude for this anime changes in Pokémon subreddits?</h5>
